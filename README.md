# Project Title :
Machine Learning-Modelling-Electric-Production-Time-Series-Data-Project.

## Project Overview :
This project focuses on predicting the consumption of electricity in the future using time series analysis. 
The time series data comprises data and consumption percentage columns. 
The goal is to explore trends, seasonality, and other data characteristics to create an efficient predictive model.

## Project Highlights :
- **Dataset Information:** The dataset includes two columns representing the date and consumption percentage.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The initial steps involve importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, and visualizing the data to gain insights.
- **Time Series Characteristics:** The project explores the time series characteristics, identifying an upward trend and seasonal patterns in the data.
- **Stationarity Check:** Various methods, including rolling window analysis and the Dickey-Fuller Test, are employed to check and achieve stationarity in the data.
- **Data Transformation:** Different techniques like differencing and log transformation are applied to make the non-stationary data stationary.
- **Modelling with SARIMAX:** Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX) is used for modeling the time series data.
- **Model Evaluation:** The project evaluates the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Residual Diagnostic Plots:** Diagnostic plots are analyzed to ensure the quality of the model, including standardized residual plots, histograms, Q-Q plots, and correlogram plots.
